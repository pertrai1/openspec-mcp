## Phase Execution Log

### Phase 0: Project Foundation

**Started**: 2026-03-30 14:20
**Completed**: 2026-03-30 14:26
**Duration**: ~6 minutes

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] 0.1: package.json
- [x] 0.2: tsconfig.json
- [x] 0.3: vitest.config.ts
- [x] 0.4: Directory structure
- [x] 0.5: Linter/formatter
- [x] 0.6: MCP SDK

**What went well**:
- Parallel execution of independent tasks (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5) worked smoothly
- All 6 tasks completed in optimal dependency order
- Quality checks passed on first try after fixing ESLint config
- Tests created before implementation (test-first workflow)
- No issues requiring PIPELINE-ISSUES.md documentation

**Challenges encountered**:
1. ESLint configuration initially used CommonJS in ESM project - fixed by converting to JSON
2. ESLint tried to lint test files with project-based rules - fixed by removing parserOptions.project
3. No source files initially caused typecheck/build failures - fixed by creating placeholder src/index.ts

**Fix attempts needed**: 2 (ESLint config issues)

### Phase 1: Basic MCP Server

**Started**: 2026-03-30 14:27
**Completed**: 2026-03-30 14:31
**Duration**: ~4 minutes

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] 1.1: Server entry point

- [x] 1.3: Resources capability
- [x] 1.4: Stdio transport
- [x] 1.5: npm bin entry
- [x] 1.6: Server tests

**What went well**:
- Server architecture cleanly separated (server.ts vs index.ts)
- MCP SDK integration worked smoothly
- All tests passed on second attempt after fixing API usage

**Challenges encountered**:
1. Initial tests used non-existent `getServerInfo()` method - fixed by using `_capabilities` property
2. Tests needed adjustment to work with actual MCP SDK API

**Fix attempts needed**: 1 (test API usage)

## Pipeline Insights

### What Worked Well

1. **Test-first workflow** - Writing tests before implementation caught issues early and provided clear success criteria
2. **Phase-based decomposition** - Breaking work into phases with clear dependencies enabled systematic progress
3. **OpenSpec change workflow** - Using openspec CLI for each phase provided structured documentation and tracking
4. **Quality check automation** - The `npm run check` command (lint + typecheck + test + build) caught issues immediately
5. **ESM module system** - Using `.js` extensions in imports worked smoothly once the pattern was established

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Agent continuation** - Agent stopped after phases 2 and 4 to provide status updates instead of continuing autonomously (documented in PIPELINE-ISSUES.md)
2. **PIPELINE-LOG timing** - Timestamps were not consistently filled in during execution, requiring retrospective reconstruction from git history
3. **Execution data loss** - Phases 2-8 lack qualitative data ("what went well", "challenges") because the agent didn't fill them in during execution
4. **Recovery from interruption** - While the system handles interruption well, session continuity could be improved
5. **Parallel execution** - More aggressive parallelization within phases could reduce total time

### Suggestions for Next Project

1. **Add explicit "do not stop" reminders** in the loop command to prevent premature pauses
2. **Automate PIPELINE-LOG updates** with timestamps captured at task boundaries
3. **Consider background test execution** to speed up the quality check phase
4. **Add progress indicators** that persist across sessions for better resumption
5. **Document ESM import patterns** in AGENTS.md to avoid early confusion with `.js` extensions

## Instructions for Agents

**After completing each phase**:
1. Fill in timestamps and duration
2. Check off completed tasks
3. Document what went well
4. Document challenges
5. Count fix attempts (re-runs of quality checks)

**At loop completion**:
1. Fill in summary metrics
2. Reflect on overall experience
3. Document pipeline insights
4. Provide actionable suggestions for improvement
