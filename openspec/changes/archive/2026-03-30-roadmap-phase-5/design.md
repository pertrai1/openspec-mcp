# Design: Phase 5 - Tool - Get Requirements

## Decisions
1. Parse spec markdown to extract Requirements section
2. Return structured requirements with IDs and content
3. Handle missing Requirements section gracefully

## Technical Approach
- Extract from `## Requirements` to next `##` heading
- Parse individual requirements (### Requirement: blocks)
- Return array of requirements with raw text
